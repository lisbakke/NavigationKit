Summary
-------
This is a fork of Axel Moller's NavigationKit project. You can find the original [here](https://github.com/sendus/NavigationKit).

Improvements over Original
--------------------------
1. Removed dependancy on Google Maps (blocked in China, and that the original implementation isn't perfectly based on GMS anyway).
2. Switched to MKLocalSearch for better POI search results.
3. UI Improvements to the example project.
4. The example project now supports encrypted GCJ02 coordinates within China.
